# Multi-Core Map Reduce (2020)
For this project I took a basic single-core implementation of the MapReduce algorithm and parallelized with the MPI library. My colleague did the same with OpenMP.

The use-cases in analysis are a simple word count function and a find common friends function, simulating a social network and a friend recommendation technique.
