A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly
crawls into infinity.
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from
a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil
Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans
to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored
space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races
home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that
can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from
the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a
giant Imperial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts
streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer, causing the main
solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.


INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old
and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face
is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
THREEPIO
Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
THREEPIO (CONT’D)
We're doomed!
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
only another robot could understand.

THREEPIO (CONT’D)
There'll be no escape for the
Princess this time.
Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud
metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are
heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
THREEPIO (CONT’D)
What's that?

EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE


The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.


INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER


The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a
score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
arms and faces.
An explosion hits near the robots.
THREEPIO
I should have known better than to
trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing
assister...
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
around the two hapless robots.


EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy
hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
lad with a prize-winning smile.

A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided
by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky
motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's
eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars
from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments
studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely
repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a
few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions
for the tiny robot to follow him.
LUKE
Hurry up! Come with me! What are you
waiting for?! Get in gear!
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms
up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his
Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.

INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP
Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
LEIA
What's wrong?
LUKE
Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really
thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA
He's got to follow his own path. No
one can choose it for him.
LUKE
I only wish Ben were here.
Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
his arm.
BIGGS
Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
get here... are you going out with
us?!
LUKE
Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
with you! Listen, have I got some
stories to tell...
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
leader.
RED LEADER
Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
been checked out on the Incom Tsixty- five?

Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
the outer rim territories.
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his
fighter.
RED LEADER

just a boy, he was a great pilot.
You'll do all right. If you've got
half of your father's skill, you'll
do better than all right.
LUKE
Thank you, sir. I'll try.
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

you'll tell me your stories when we
come back. All right?
LUKE

Biggs.
BIGGS
(going off)
You did, all right. It's going to be
like old times, Luke. We're a couple
of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
his ship.
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly
spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft,
points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on
the back of the fighter.
CHIEF
This R2 unit of your seems a bit
beat up. Do you want a new one?
LUKE
Not on your life! That little droid
and I have been through a lot
together.

their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
arms and faces.
An explosion hits near the robots.
THREEPIO

trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing

Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
around the two hapless robots.


EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy
hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
lad with a prize-winning smile.

A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided
by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky
motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's
eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars
from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments
studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely
repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a
few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions
for the tiny robot to follow him.
LUKE
Hurry up! Come with me! What are you
waiting for?! Get in gear!
The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms
up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his
Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.

INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP
Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
LEIA
What's wrong?
LUKE
Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really
thought he'd change his mind.
LEIA
He's got to follow his own path. No
one can choose it for him.
LUKE
I only wish Ben were here.
Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
his arm.
BIGGS
Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
get here... are you going out with
us?!
LUKE
Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
with you! Listen, have I got some
stories to tell...
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
leader.
RED LEADER
Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
been checked out on the Incom Tsixty- five?

208

BIGGS
Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
the outer rim territories.
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his
fighter.
RED LEADER
I met your father once when I was
just a boy, he was a great pilot.
You'll do all right. If you've got
half of your father's skill, you'll
do better than all right.
LUKE
Thank you, sir. I'll try.
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
BIGGS
I've got to get aboard. Listen,
you'll tell me your stories when we
come back. All right?
LUKE
I told you I'd make it someday,
Biggs.
BIGGS
(going off)
You did, all right. It's going to be
like old times, Luke. We're a couple
of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
his ship.
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly
spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft,
points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on
the back of the fighter.
CHIEF
This R2 unit of your seems a bit
beat up. Do you want a new one?
LUKE
Not on your life! That little droid
and I have been through a lot
together.
(to Artoo)
You okay, Artoo?

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly
crawls into infinity.
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from
a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil
Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans
to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored
space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races
home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that
can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from
the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a
giant Imperial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts
streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer, causing the main
solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.


INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old
and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face
is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
THREEPIO
Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
THREEPIO (CONT’D)
We're doomed!
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
only another robot could understand.

THREEPIO (CONT’D)
There'll be no escape for the
Princess this time.
Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud
metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are
heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
THREEPIO (CONT’D)
What's that?

EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE


The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

us?!
LUKE
Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
with you! Listen, have I got some
stories to tell...
Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
leader.
RED LEADER
Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
been checked out on the Incom Tsixty- five?

208

118.

BIGGS
Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
the outer rim territories.
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his
fighter.
RED LEADER
I met your father once when I was
just a boy, he was a great pilot.
You'll do all right. If you've got
half of your father's skill, you'll
do better than all right.
LUKE
Thank you, sir. I'll try.
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
BIGGS
I've got to get aboard. Listen,
you'll tell me your stories when we
come back. All right?
LUKE
I told you I'd make it someday,
Biggs.
BIGGS
(going off)
You did, all right. It's going to be
like old times, Luke. We're a couple
of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
his ship.
As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly
spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft,
points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on
the back of the fighter.
CHIEF
This R2 unit of your seems a bit
beat up. Do you want a new one?
LUKE
Not on your life! That little droid
and I have been through a lot
together.
(to Artoo)
You okay, Artoo?
